# Execution and restart model

Runner observations progress through `prepared`, `process_started`, `process_exited`, `result_persisted`, `submission_attempted`, `reconciled_accepted`, `waiting_for_attention`, `failed`, and `cancelled`. These labels do not duplicate agent-loop's state machine.

Every run/resume reloads the typed `ExecutionProjection`. Run, Contract revision, plan digest, stage, attempt, base, and candidate mismatches fail closed. Read-only stages must preserve the candidate hash. Attention stops execution. Process exit zero, prose, and file presence never imply acceptance.

Runtime JSON uses atomic temporary-file writes, flush/fsync where available, restrictive permissions, and same-filesystem rename. Corrupt or partial JSON is rejected rather than repaired.
